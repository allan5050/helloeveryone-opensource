# Design & Marketing Copy Guide for HelloEveryone

_Based on Seth Godin's principles from Purple Cow, Tribes, and Permission Marketing_

## Core Philosophy

### The Story We Tell

People don't buy products; they buy the story they tell themselves. HelloEveryone isn't a matching
platform—it's permission to belong.

**Our users' internal narrative:**

- "I deserve real connections, not more screen time"
- "There are people like me out there"
- "Meeting people should feel natural, not forced"

### Purple Cow Principle

Be remarkable or be invisible. We're not another dating app—we're the anti-app. While others keep
you swiping, we get you meeting.

## Language Principles

### 1. Talk Like a Human, Not a Company

❌ "Smart social matching for busy adults" ✅ "Meet your people. For real."

❌ "Intelligent compatibility scoring" ✅ "We'll introduce you to people you'll actually like"

❌ "AI-powered matching system" ✅ "Find people who get you"

### 2. Make It About Them, Not Us

❌ "Our platform offers..." ✅ "You'll meet..."

❌ "We provide intelligent matching" ✅ "Find people who share your weird"

### 3. Permission, Not Interruption

- Don't sell—invite
- Don't convince—connect
- Don't explain—demonstrate

### 4. Tribes Over Features

People don't want features; they want to belong. Focus on:

- Connection over technology
- Stories over statistics
- Outcomes over processes

## Copy Guidelines

### Headlines

- Short. Direct. Human.
- Maximum 5 words when possible
- Use "you" and "your"
- Action-oriented

**Examples:**

- "Meet your people"
- "Real friends. Real life."
- "Your tribe is waiting"
- "Stop swiping. Start meeting."

### Body Copy

- One idea per sentence
- Show, don't tell
- Use specifics, not abstractions
- Write like you talk

**Instead of:** "Our sophisticated matching algorithm analyzes multiple data points to ensure
optimal compatibility between users."

**Write:** "Answer a few questions. Meet people you'll actually like. It's that simple."

### Calls to Action

- Clear and specific
- Create urgency through desire, not fear
- One primary action per screen

**Good CTAs:**

- "Join free"
- "Find your people"
- "Start meeting"
- "See who's near you"

**Avoid:**

- "Learn more"
- "Get started"
- "Sign up now"
- "Submit"

## Design Principles

### 1. Progressive Disclosure

Like OkCupid, reveal complexity gradually:

- Step 1: Email only
- Step 2: Basic info
- Step 3: Preferences
- Each step builds investment

### 2. Reduce Cognitive Load

- One question at a time
- Clear progress indicators
- Default to simple choices
- Optional complexity

### 3. Social Proof Through Action

Instead of testimonials, show:

- "23 people joined today in [Your City]"
- "Event tomorrow: 8 people going"
- Activity, not claims

### 4. The Velvet Rope

Create desire through selective access:

- "Accepting new members in [City]"
- Quality over quantity messaging
- Curated, not open

## Homepage Strategy

### The OkCupid Approach

1. **Immediate value proposition** (5-10 words max)
2. **Single, clear action** (Join free)
3. **Minimal friction** (Email only to start)
4. **Progressive commitment** (Details come later)

### What to Remove

- Feature lists
- How it works sections
- Testimonials
- FAQ (move to separate page)
- Multiple CTAs
- Stats without context
- Technology explanations

### What to Keep/Add

- One clear headline
- One subhead (if necessary)
- One primary CTA
- Login link for existing users
- Trust signals (brief, subtle)

## Messaging Examples

### For Different User Mindsets

**The Skeptic:** "No algorithms. No gimmicks. Just real people at real events."

**The Busy Professional:** "One event. Ten new people. Zero time wasted."

**The Introvert:** "Small groups. Shared interests. No pressure."

**The Newcomer:** "New in town? Your people are already here."

## Words to Use

## The Seth Godin Test

Before publishing any copy, ask:

1. Would a real person say this to a friend?
2. Does it make a promise we can keep?
3. Is it remarkable enough to share?
4. Does it respect their intelligence?
5. Are we earning attention or demanding it?

## Implementation Priority

1. **Homepage**: Strip down to essentials
2. **Signup flow**: Progressive, frictionless
3. **Event pages**: Focus on who's going, not what
4. **Profile setup**: Make it feel like play, not work
5. **Messaging**: Keep it human and helpful

## Remember

"People like us do things like this." - Seth Godin

HelloEveryone is for people who:

- Choose real life over digital life
- Value depth over breadth
- Want friends, not followers
- Believe the best connections happen in person

Make every word count. Make every word human.
